Implementation of a reslicing algorithm that obtains
an image slice in a non-orthogonal plane reasonable
for viewing "positioning" parameter of the re-slicing
algorithm?

-   Why do we need such a reslicing algorithm in 
    clinical practice?
-   What are the reasonable "positioning" parameter
    of the the re-slicing algorithm?
-   Visualise re-sliced example in 2D and 3D with 
    varying positioning parameters values.

Applying a chosen nonlinear filtering for abdominal MR images.
o Motivation and description of the selected algorithms, for both 2D and 3D versions.
o What are the parameters of the filter?
o Analyse the impact due to varying filter parameter values.
o Discuss the computational performance of the filtering.

"""
Compare two approaches, “3D-filtering before re-slicing” and “2D-filtering after re-slicing”.
o Visualise the results from both approaches.
o Qualitative comparison between the two approaches.
o What metrics can be used for quantifying the difference between the two approaches?
o Quantitative comparison between the two approaches.
o Discuss the potential clinical impact due the observed difference.
